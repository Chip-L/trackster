# trackster

Codecademy project. Unit 9 bonus project - a music track listener

"In this project, you will build a music search app using the MusicGraph API (https://developer.musicgraph.com/). The app has a text input field and a search button. When a user inputs some text and clicks the button, the app will search MusicGraph's database for songs related to that text. When the API request is complete, the app displays each song found in a list. The user can then sort the list in a number of ways and listen to a sample of each song via a play button."

The initial specs are in the MISC folder in resources. When complete the Codecademy solution will be there too.

Codecademy's working site is here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/trackster/index.html - it doesn't appear to sort.

# My notes and observations:
So the description says this uses MusicGraph and links to that API. In actuality, when you get in to the steps, it uses LastFM. Fortunately the steps provide the proper links.
